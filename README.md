a linguistic and runtime technology for algorithmic multithreaded programming.


## Requirements

To build/install this roll you must have root access to a Rocks development
machine (e.g., a frontend or development appliance).

If your Rocks development machine does *not* have Internet access you must
download the appropriate R source file(s) using a machine that does have
Internet access and copy them into the `src/<packages>` directories on your
Rocks development machine.


## Dependencies

Building the cilk roll currently requires the use of Intel compilers due to a
bug in the cilkutil build; see "cilkprof failing to compile" on
https://software.intel.com/en-us/taxonomy/term/36927?page=13.  If "gnu" and
"intel" environment modules are present, the build process will load them
appropriately.


## Building

To build the cilk-roll, execute this on a rocks development
machine (e.g., a frontend or development appliance):

```shell
% make 2>&1 | tee build.log
```

A successful build will create the file `weka-*.disk1.iso`.  If you built the
roll on a Rocks frontend, proceed to the installation step. If you built the
roll on a Rocks development appliance, you need to copy the roll to your Rocks
frontend before continuing with installation.


## Installation

To install, execute these instructions on a Rocks frontend:

```shell
% rocks add roll *.iso
% rocks enable roll cilk
% cd /export/rocks/install
% rocks create distro
% rocks run roll cilk | bash
```

In addition to the software itself, the roll installs cilk environment module
files in:

```shell
/opt/modulefiles/applications/cilk
```

## Testing

The cilk-roll includes a test script which can be run to verify proper
installation of the roll documentation, binaries and module files. To run
the test scripts execute the following command(s):

```shell
% /root/rolltests/cilk.t 
```
